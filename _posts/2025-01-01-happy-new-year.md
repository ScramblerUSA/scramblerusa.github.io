### Happy new year!

As one of my New Year resolutions I decided to finally create a site to share my work with the people.
It just so happened that a few days ago I discovered github pages and Jekyll and it clicked - I'll do it this way. It makes for a pretty good static web site, which is pretty much perfect for sharing the information and documenting things.

I'll try my best to keep this site alive. However, since I only have a little spare time, it's gonna be on pretty relaxed update schedule. Please be patient.

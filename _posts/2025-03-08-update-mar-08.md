### Project updates 2

Time for an update, I guess. Long overdue, actually.
The guide is slowly growing. I have a huge backlog of photos to process and a lot to write, but don't have enough time. Making stuff for my own house has higher priority - it pleases my wife, who in turn allows me to have some spare time to work on my stuff.

So far the following devices have been created and tested:
- Single switch
- 2-gang switch
- Dimmer
- 2-gang dimmer
- Dimmer + triac dimmer
- Dimmer + ceiling fan controller

And the following add-ons:
- Radar motion sensor
- 433 MHz transmitter (allows to control other things, like remote doorbells)
- 433 MHz receiver (allows switch to be controlled by external RF remotes)

Also, 2 pogo pin jigs have been created: for Tuya switches and for ESP-02S modules.

Take a look around [the project](/sdsh/) to find out more.

Thermostat, smoke alarms, power sockets are still in the works.
Jigs for flashing 2-gang switches and to open the smart plug cases are also in development.

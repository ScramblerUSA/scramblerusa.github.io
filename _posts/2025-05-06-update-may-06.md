### Project updates 3

It feels like it is time for an update, I guess. Again 2 month after the last one.

Not much progress has been made due to lack of spare time. Also the struggle between desire to share my
project with the world and me not being a writer, really. It's rather hard (as I found out) to document
everything, especially not in my native language.

Anyhow, here I am at it again, trying to write more of this sweet documentation. Stay tuned!

Just for fun, here's the picture of my experimental setup which allows me to iterate on designs faster:

Just some wires connected in parralel to existing switches leading into a molex connector. Simple, but effective.
Allows to (relatively) safely unplug the experimental device, modify it and plug back in again. Don't do this at home.

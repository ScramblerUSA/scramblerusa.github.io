### Project updates

So far I spend a lot of my spare time working on this site, mostly on SimpleDiySmartHome (SDSH) project. Buying guide is still work in progress, but there are more and more items being added.
These are the pages in active development today:
- [Sourcing tools](/sdsh/buytools/)
- [Sourcing smart devices](/sdsh/buydevices/)
- [Sourcing components](/sdsh/buycomponents/)

Next I'll document the pogo pin jig and start writing about switches and dimmers. Please be patient, it really takes a lot of time to document everything and make all the pictures.

- [Switches and dimmers](/sdsh/switches/)

Just wanted to tease a little bit. I started this site after I've done some progress on some devices - to me it makes no sense to start a site about something you only want to make. Let me showcase a few switches that can be made for $5-$10 each.

First off, the humble simple single light switch:

Here's it's bigger brother - double light switch:

A bit more advanced dimmer switch:

**There's more than meets the eye, though!** All of these devices can be equipped with add-ons. So far I already have these working:
- Motion sensor (radar type). It's completely invisible, but works wonders. Double light switch shown above has it installed. 
- 433 MHz receiver. Allows the switch to be controlled wirelessly without the phone. Useful when you need to make it a 3-way switch or a 4-way switch.
- 433 MHz transmitter. Gives the ability to control other wireless devices. Radio doorbell is a good example.

I also have various remote controls working: radio button, radio switch, radio remote control

It should also be possible to add:
- PIR motion sensor (regular dome type). I tried it, but didn't like the aesthetics of a dome protruding from a switch paddle.
- Humidity/temperature sensor. I plan to use such switches for my bathroom fans.
- And more.

Other devices I want to make in the future:
- Smart 2-gang dimmer
- Smart combined dimmer + fan speed controller
- Smart power socket
- Smart thermostat
- Remote thermometers for said thermostat (to monitor temperature in each room)
- Smart smoke alarms
- Light sensor

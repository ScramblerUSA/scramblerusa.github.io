To make things you will need some tools and most likely you already own many tools needed. However, in case you need something, here are inexpensive tools that work.
In case the link doesn't work I also give a picture, so you have an idea of what to look for. Click the picture to view the larger version.

The most obvious tool you'll need is a soldering iron. Temperature-controlled soldering station works the best, but is on more expensive side. I'd recommend to invest in one if you plan to continue with the hobby. Otherwise here are some inexpensive options:

[Simple soldering iron](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800658356713.html) - AC-powered with temperature control. Looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/iron1t.png)](/images/buying-guide/iron1.png)

[Portable soldering iron](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806491809622.html) - battery-powered, good enough for a few solder joints. Looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/iron2t.png)](/images/buying-guide/iron2.png)

[Soldering flux](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806680350808.html), looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/fluxt.png)](/images/buying-guide/flux.png)


Multimeter is another essential tool. I use [Aneng AN8009](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805987916385.html). AN8008 is the same, but without a temperature probe. Looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/anengt.png)](/images/buying-guide/aneng.png)

USB to UART adapter. This thing is needed to reprogram the devices to our liking. Some of them are better than others. Here are a few I like.

[CH343P adapter](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804302118838.html) - pretty good one all around. However, is NOT strong enough to power the device. Looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/ch343pt.png)](/images/buying-guide/ch343p.png)

[DAPLINK](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803753392042.html) - provides UART port as well as debugging interface for ARM microcontrollers. This one IS strong enough to power the device. Looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/daplinkt.png)](/images/buying-guide/daplink.png)

[4 channel UART bridge](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805684027122.html) - provides 4 UART interfaces. This one is strong enough to power the device, however, a resistor needs to be resoldered into 3.3V position, otherwise you'll burn the poor thing. Looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/uart4cht.png)](/images/buying-guide/uart4ch.png)

In general if you look for an adapter that can power the device being reprogrammed, look for AMS1117 regulator on the board. It looks like a large chip: ![](/images/buying-guide/uartpwrgood.png), if you see the small regulator chip: ![](/images/buying-guide/uartpwrbad.png) chances are it is not strong enough and will overheat and burn out.
DAPLINK mentioned above has the small chip on pictures, however that seller sends a newer board version now with AMS1117 on board. Make sure to check the reviews section for most relevant photos.



Some general purpose things...

[Screwdriver + bits](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806910404175.html) - cheap, but decent kit, looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/screwdrivert.png)](/images/buying-guide/screwdriver.png)

[Side cutters](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806236020667.html) - looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/sidecutterst.png)](/images/buying-guide/sidecutters.png)

[Knife + blades](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805770764373.html) - cheap exacto-knife clone, looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/knifet.png)](/images/buying-guide/knife.png)

[Glue gun](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832840437862.html) - cheap, but works. Looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/gluegunt.png)](/images/buying-guide/gluegun.png)

[Glue sticks](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805227792305.html) - inexpensive consumables for glue gun, looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/gluestickst.png)](/images/buying-guide/gluesticks.png)

[Rotary tool](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806674744544.html) - cheapest I was able to find. I'd still recommend a dremel or similar, but this one is enough to modify switch paddles per this guide. Looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/rotaryt.png)](/images/buying-guide/rotary.png)

[Mini saws](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804084842934.html) - required to modify switch padddles. Looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/sawst.png)](/images/buying-guide/saws.png)

[UV resin](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807311086864.html) - used to create transparent windows for lights, etc. Looks like this: [![](/images/buying-guide/uvresint.png)](/images/buying-guide/uvresin.png)

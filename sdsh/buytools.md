To make things you will need some tools and most likely you already own many tools needed. However, in case you need something, here are inexpensive tools that work.
In case the link doesn't work I also give a picture, so you have an idea of what to look for. Click the picture to view the larger version.

The most obvious tool you'll need is a soldering iron. Temperature-controlled soldering station works the best, but is on more expensive side. I'd recommend to invest in one if you plan to continue with the hobby. Here are some inexpensive options:

|T12 soldering station|There are many models, search for "T12 station" and choose one to your liking. A few examples: [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808047445464.html), [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808088319322.html), or [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800877306797.html)|

Multimeter is another essential tool. If you don't have one already, I'd recommend this one. I use it myself and happy with it. Very good value for the money.

USB to UART adapter. This thing is needed to reprogram the devices to our liking. Some of them are better than others. Here are a few I like.

|[![](/images/buying-guide/ch343pt.png)](/images/buying-guide/ch343p.png)|[CH343P adapter](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804302118838.html) - pretty good one all around. However, is NOT strong enough to power the device.|
|[![](/images/buying-guide/daplinkt.png)](/images/buying-guide/daplink.png)|[DAPLINK](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803753392042.html) - provides UART port as well as debugging interface for ARM microcontrollers. This one IS strong enough to power the device.|
|[![](/images/buying-guide/uart4cht.png)](/images/buying-guide/uart4ch.png)|[4 channel UART bridge](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805684027122.html) - provides 4 UART interfaces. This one is strong enough to power the device, however, a resistor needs to be resoldered into 3.3V position, otherwise you'll burn the poor thing.|

In general if you look for an adapter that can power the device being reprogrammed, look for AMS1117 regulator on the board. It looks like a large chip: ![](/images/buying-guide/uartpwrgood.png), if you see the small regulator chip: ![](/images/buying-guide/uartpwrbad.png) chances are it is not strong enough and will overheat and burn out.
DAPLINK mentioned above has the small chip on pictures, however that seller sends a newer board version now with AMS1117 on board. Make sure to check the reviews section for most relevant photos.

A short teardown instruction to get certain components from larger assemblies.

##### Switch rockers and bumpers

Switch rockers and bumpers are extracted from Eaton switches (sold at Lowe's).
All you need to do is to put a large screwdriver in the side slot and twist it, opening the slot wider.
The rocker will pop out a little, as it is spring-loaded:

You will need to pull it out the rest of the way. Once the rocker is removed, make sure to pull out the bumpers:

We will use these bumpers as a means to press the switch button.

##### Smart switch boards

To extract the board from the housing you can either use a really thin screwdriver or a spudger to just pry the case apart:
Don't worry about damage to the case - we will not need it anyway.

Another option is to use an exacto-knife (or similar) to cut the clips on one side.
It really is enough to score them and they will give way:

Open the case and slide the board out.

##### Dimmer boards

Dimmers have a different case construction.
In order to open it with minimal chance of damaging the board I suggest to use a small screwdriver and squeeze it between the case and the lid just above the button:

Then pry the lid open and remove it. Once it is done, pull the board out in a tilting motion:

Don't pull it out straight, it has to rotate around the connector block slightly.

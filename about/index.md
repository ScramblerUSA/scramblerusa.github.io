<p>
Hi there, I'm Alexander. Alex for short. Nice to meet you! 
</p>

<p>
I am a software engineer by trade. I've been a software engineer since the early 2000s, which is pretty much my entire adult life.
My interests are not limited to software, though. Since childhood I was fascinated with electricity and everything electric. This fascination lead me to my hobby: electronics. I started with making simple AM radio receivers and then built progressively more complex and interesting circuits.
Making things from wood was my another hobby. I like to make everything from anything in general. 3D printing is another big thing for me. I started with RepRap Mendel in 2011. Recently I picked up 3D design, so I'm not limited by publicly available models.
</p>

<p>
I am happily married and together we are raising 2 beautiful children and a cat. We all currently live in the sate of Texas, USA.
</p>

Although my life is intertwined with computers, I'm not a huge social network guy, so no facebook, twitter and such. Instead you can find me on:

If you found some of my stuff useful, please consider buying me a coffee. No pressure, though: if you are struggling to pay the bills, please do not. <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ScramblerUSA" class="btn" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-mug-hot" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
